## Introduction

FPGA also known as Field-Programmable Gate Array, is a hardware circuit board that executes hardware models. It is used for prototyping ASICs and Processors.
This workshop is to learn and understand Digital Design using Virtual FPGA.

## Benefits of Virtual FPGA

1. Virtual demo FPGA visualizations
2. Access to various kinds of Board
3. Debug each & every cycle
4. Open-source (Freely access to all)
